  Ever run out of ideas on what kind of background that you want to use for your
  next design project? Or maybe for that cool illustrations that you're working
  on but the colours aren't quite right? Well, let's try some colour gradients.

I get it. Sometimes, it's really hard to create a gradient that fits well with what you envisioned for your design. It can take hours just to get that right colour combination for a gradient. But rest assure, in this article, I've compiled a list of websites where you can look into for some cool colour gradients that you can use. These websites are my go-to whenever I want to use some quick gradient for my design. So, let's get into it.
