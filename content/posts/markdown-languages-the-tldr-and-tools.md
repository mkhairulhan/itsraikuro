  Markdown is a lightweight markup language, that turns plain-text to other
  different formatting, mainly to HTML. You would usually see markdown being
  used on Github, Gitlab, etc or maybe bundled together as a package for
  software release that uses markdown for documentation (markdown files are
  stored as .md type).

FYI, all the blog post in this website are also written in markdown syntax. It allows for an easy-to-write, easy-to-read in plain text format for rapid content creation, especially for writers, bloggers, etc. Markdown can easily be integrated in any CMS or website for content creation, although it is still depends on whether the platform you use supports it or not.  Markdown, in some way, are better and easier than HTML syntax (in terms of styling and formating) and any other WYSIWYG tools (as some of them have limited option).

Although markdown has some bit learning curve to it, once you have get the grip, it would become a powerful writing tool which provides you with different options so that you would have a full control over it. And what's more, is that markdown would help a team to get on a same page quickly and with less error when working together. You can learn more about markdown language from other website for it's syntax and usage, as this post is only to give you some insight on what markdown is and the tools to write it with.


## Tools to write in markdown language.

Don't get me wrong. Although it states "tools" there, it doesn't mean that it requires a specific, heavy on computer resources IDE for people to be able to write in markdown language. You could use your already favourite text editor to write in markdown. Heck, you could even use the default notepad editor in Windows OS and save it as .md file (well, all markdown file need to save as .md). 

But the tools that I listed here are some of the specific markdown editor especially if you didn't have any text editor or you just hate to write it on the default notepad. Whatever the reasons are, these tools would surely help you to become better in writing markdown, either for your projects, web development, or just wanted to write some mystery genre novel in your free time.  

_P/S: All the tools listed below are **free** to use._

### Conclusion
Personally, I used **Typora** as my main markdown editor, as it is by far the best one that I've used with sufficient features that I really need. And whenever I'm on another laptop or workstation, I would use **Dillinger** as my web editor as it have a clean UI, pleasing to the eye kind, with some great features like export to different format, save to my cloud storage, etc.

Moreover, like I've said before, even though I've list some tools to write markdown, that doesn't mean that other text editor couldn't be used as a markdown editor. For example, Visual Studio Code or VSC, an open source text editor by Microsoft, can also be used as a markdown editor. You just need to install or download some plugin to enable or support markdown language in the text editor. Same goes for Sublime text editor, Atom by Github, and any other text editor that can support markdown language. Give markdown a try, even if you wouldn't love it, you would surely like it. Happy writing!
