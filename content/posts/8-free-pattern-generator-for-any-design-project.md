  Patterns. The right pattern design would be perfect for any kind of background
  for a design project. Forget the solid or gradient color background when you
  have patterns to use. Geometric patterns? Abstract patterns? Or maybe even a
  sticker of your cat could be use as patterns. But what if you're to lazy or
  tired to think of anything to use as a pattern? Well, why not use these 8 free
  pattern generators to spiced up your project.
